Description: Spatially-aware quality control (QC) software for both spot-level 
    and artifact-level QC in spot-based spatial transcripomics, such as 10x 
    Visium. These methods are based on using information from nearest-neighbors 
    to identify local outliers spots and large technical artifacts.
