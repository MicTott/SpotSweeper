Description: Spatially-aware quality control (QC) software for both spot-level 
    and artifact-level QC in spot-based spatial transcripomics, such as 10x 
    Visium. These methods calculate local (nearest-neighbors) mean and variance 
    of standard QC metrics (library size, unique genes, and mitochondrial 
    percentage) to identify outliers spot and large technical artifacts. Scales
    linearly with the number of spots and is designed to be used with
    'SpatialExperiment' objects.
